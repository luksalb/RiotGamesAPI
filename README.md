# RiotGamesAPI
## Using Riot API to transform Data.

I made this repository for myself, to learn how to integrate APIs and also how to manipulate Riot's API. For now, I can fetch Summoner's account information and Ranked history. 

### Goals for the nearest future:
1- Get History of Summoners Matches (Currently, it brings 403 forbidden message).
2- Get data like how many matches played, KDA, most champion played.

### Goals for the farthest future:
1- Transform everything into a cool looking website
2- Create a website used by the community to read data about professional players and themselves and see in what they can improve.
